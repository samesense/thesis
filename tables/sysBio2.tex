\caption[Fisher's test for virus hub dependency factor
  preference]{\small The table shows the number of inter/intramodular
  hubs considered when testing for an association between hub class
  and virus dependency factors, as well as the results from a
  one-tailed Fisher's exact test. Only host factors required for HIV
  replication are associated with intramodular hubs. Calculations were
  performed using the average and median to calculate a measure of
  co-expression between hubs and their interacting neighbors (see
  text). \label{tbl:sysBio:rnaiFisher}}
