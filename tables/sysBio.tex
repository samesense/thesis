\caption[Fisher's test for virus hub preference]{\small The table
  shows the number of virus targeted inter/intramodular hubs
  considered when testing for an association between hub class and
  virus interaction, as well as the results from a one-tailed Fisher's
  exact test. HIV and the influenza virus target proteins that are
  enriched in intramodular hubs, while HCV targeted proteins almost
  show a preference for intermodular hubs. Calculations were performed
  using the average and median to calculate a measure of co-expression
  between hubs and their interacting neighbors (see
  text). \label{tbl:sysBio:bindingFisher}}
