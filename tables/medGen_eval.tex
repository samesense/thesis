\caption[Overlap between predicted and validated HIV-human
  interactions]{\small For each HIV protein, we evaluated the
  significance of the overlap between human proteins in HIV-human
  predicted and validated interactions. The HHP column gives the
  number of human proteins that were predicted to interact with an HIV
  protein, while HHE shows the number of verified virus targeted
  proteins in the NCBI database. The Overlap column counts the number
  of proteins in both sets. P-values for the overlap between predicted
  and validated HIV targeted proteins were calculated using a
  hypergeometric test (see Methods). We limited our results to HIV
  proteins with at least ten verified interactions with human
  proteins. \label{tbl:medGen:eval}}
